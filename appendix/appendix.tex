\section{Appendix B: First Contact Email} \label{appendix_first_contact}
Hello,\\
I am Francisco Crespi, I am a student based in Barcelona, currently doing a Master\textquotesingle s program on Cognitive Systems and Interactive Media at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I am working on my final research project, which is framed in the context of Educational Technology. 
This project explores how the usability of a particular tool relates to teacher\textquotesingle s orchestration load. To perform this analysis, I am looking to do a usability evaluation of an interface that the teachers use in class while moderating an activity with students. Specifically, I am planning to do an Heuristic Evaluation with 3 to 5 usability experts. I am contacting you because I read your paper <Paper name> and think that you would be an ideal candidate to perform this evaluation. 
If you are interested in contributing, I would send you the necessary materials for you to get to know the app and then do the evaluation. Since I rely on the voluntary help of researchers like you, the materials and evaluation are designed for them to take the least amount possible of your time. It should take between 1 and 2 hours.
Your contribution to this project would be immensely helpful. Would you like to participate?\\
Thanks in advance.
