Recent changes in technology made a profound impact on our lives, and classrooms are no exception. As the field of Learning Design grows, new educational paradigms, concepts and tools are developed. Consequently, assessing the impact of these new developments in orchestration load is becoming increasingly necessary to support teachers as they integrate technology in their classrooms. This project explores the relationship between usability and teachers' orchestration load, in the context of a Pyramid flow activity using PyramidApp. To perform this analysis, usability evaluations are triangulated with EDA information, field research and self perception measures to assess these relationship of these two concepts.
